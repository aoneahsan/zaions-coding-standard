# Rules for ENVs

- any time we add or remove a ENV, we need to add/remove it's dummy entry in env.example file (add explanation of that env as value of that env in the env.example file)

## Record of ENVs in Project

- add any new ENV added in project with explanation of its role and the values it needs
