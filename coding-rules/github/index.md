## GitHub Branch Naming Conventions

### Naming Main Branches

- Main branches should be named as 'v1', 'v2', 'v3', etc.

### Naming Task Test/Implementation Branches

- Test branches should be name as first the name of developer slash ('/') name of feature or task and after that 't1 (1,2,3 number of test)' for test and v1 for actual integration for example 'ahsan/name-of-task-t1' or 'ahsan/name-of-task-v1'
- Test branches should be named with the first the name of the developer followed by a slash ('/') and then the name of the feature or task.
- For test branches, append 't1' (1,2,3 representing the number of tests) for testing purposes.
- For actual integration, use 'v1' instead of 't1'. For example:
  - 'ahsan/name-of-task-t1' for testing
  - 'ahsan/name-of-task-v1' for actual integration branches
